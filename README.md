# UNP_PROJECT_WITH_SQL_MAVEN_MARKET_DATASET

This project involved designing and executing queries on a structured relational database called Maven Market, built using SQL. The database was designed to simulate a retail environment and included interconnected tables such as Customers, Orders, Products, OrderDetails, and Suppliers. The initial phase involved creating normalized tables with appropriate keys and constraints to ensure data integrity. Once the data was inserted, various SQL queries were written to solve business-related problems and extract insights. The project explored key SQL concepts such as joins to combine data across multiple tables, subqueries for dynamic filtering, and aggregate functions like SUM and COUNT to calculate total sales and order quantities. GROUP BY and HAVING clauses were used to segment and analyze data meaningfully, while set operations like UNION helped handle and compare different query results. Overall, the project highlighted practical SQL skills applied to a real-world dataset, showcasing the ability to structure databases effectively and write efficient queries for data analysis and reporting.
